# Rical

The latest calendar app for minimalists.

("screenshot" coming soon, it'll just be copy pasted from the terminal)

This app is far from complete! Check back soon, mark your calendars...

## Core Objectives
- Organize events or tasks at certain dates/times
- Offer (ideally cross-platform) system notifications for the events of each day
- Store calendars in a full-scale database and allow multiple accounts, for scalability and cross-device usage
- Offer a lightweight, intuitive TUI frontend with efficient keybinds

## Architecture requirements
**Rical Backend**
- Basic authentication (log in with username and password to get JWT)
- Store users and their private calendars
- Access and write calendars via a friendly and simple API

**Rical Frontend UI**
- Display an intuitive calendar TUI, much like existing calendar GUI apps
- Each day should show tasks and users can complete them, view details, navigate across the calendar, etc.
- Allow the user to configure the backend URL and authenticate with the backend, storing their auth tokens persistently to avoid constant signouts
- Allow the user to complete tasks and add tasks

**Drical (the Daemon for Rical)**
- Offer system notifications once a day for the calendar tasks that will appear that day
- Work cross-platform; constantly run in the background, but be very lightweight
- If the user has not opened their computer/ran Drical for multiple days, show all the tasks that have accumulated over the unviewed days

**Deployment**
- Create docs for self-hosting (make it easy to self-host, possibly even just running an instance completely locally)
- Deploy the backend
- Possibly make a simple frontend website for easy mobile access across devices

## Technologies
**Backend**
- Rust ðŸ¦€
- PostgreSQL
- Axum

**Frontend**
- Rust ðŸ¦€
- Crossterm TUI library (Ratatui is too high-level for this project; we require very specific details)

**Drical**
- Rust ðŸ¦€
- Libraries and technologies to be determined

## Etymology?
The acronym RICAL stands for:
- ***R***ical
- ***I***sn't a
- ***Cal***endar

Yes, it is in fact a date-based event/task management system, not a calendar.
